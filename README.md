# React Todo's Assignment

# Installation
* \> npm install
* \> npm start

The app with a single view should now be running at  http://localhost:8080  

Note: Hot reloading should work for all .js files so no need to refresh all the time.

# Instructions

You will be given a static html interface for a simple 'Todo' application. Your assignment is
to make it dynamic and functional using React. All html and css has already been provided for you. Complete as much functionality as you can in the allotted time.

Note: To keep things simple for time constraints, use component state to hold the todo items list (i.e. no need for Redux or Flux).
